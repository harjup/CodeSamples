Example work from previous projects

This Repo currently includes:

ManuscriptLoader.cs - A script that parses through xml data, turning that information into a set of dialog objects which are initialized into the current scene. The data accessed depends on the name of the scene currently loaded.

ManuscriptLoader_Data.xml - An example of the xml data that ManuscriptLoader uses. Origially named "BeanStreet.xml".

ProjectEuler.cs - A set of solutions to specific projects for projecteuler, a site centering around programatically finding solutions to math problems that would be nearly impossible to solve by hand.

RenderScript.ms - A script that automates specific rendering functionality in 3D Studio Max. Written in Maxscript.
